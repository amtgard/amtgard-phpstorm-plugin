# Amtgard Builder Hints

Provides declaration/implementation completions for [Amtgard Builder Traits](https://github.com/amtgard/builder-traits).

This adds fun little autocompletes when you type the arrow operator (->) to variables identifiable as classes with 
the Amtgard Builder, Getter, Setter, or ToBuilder traits.
